# Dicee ðŸŽ²

Dicee is a dice-rolling app developed as part of Section 4 in Angela Yu's iOS Development Bootcamp on Udemy. The app allows users to roll two dice with a tap of a button, generating random results for both dice. The primary focus of this project was learning **Auto Layout** to create responsive designs suitable for all screen sizes.

## Features
- ðŸŽ² Tap to roll two random dice
- ðŸ’¡ Simple and intuitive UI
- ðŸ“± Fully responsive design using Auto Layout
- ðŸ›  Built with Swift and UIKit

## Purpose
This project was a part of Section 4 of the Udemy course, where I learned to:
- Implement **Auto Layout** to adapt the UI across various devices and orientations
- Work with **randomization** to simulate dice rolls
- Enhance my understanding of **UI components** like `UIImageView`, `UIButton`, and `UILabel`
- Practice **basic project structure** and code organization in Swift
